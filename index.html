            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>MathGPT is a tool designed to democratize learning in mathematics and physics using AI technology.</p>
            <h3>Mission</h3>
            <p>Our mission at MathGPT is to democratize learning and problem-solving in mathematics and physics, leveraging the power of artificial intelligence. We focus on developing and providing a GPT-based tool that is intuitive, accessible, and free, aimed at assisting students, educators, and self-learners around the world. Guided by principles of equity and inclusion, we commit to supporting those who lack direct access to advanced technology, do not possess programming skills, or face economic constraints. Our goal is to be a valuable resource and a companion on the journey towards knowledge and improvement, contributing to a global community of learners. We are dedicated to fostering understanding, curiosity, and innovation in science, making technical and scientific education more accessible and enriching for everyone.</p>
            <h3>Vision</h3>
            <p>At MathGPT, we aspire to be a world reference in integrating artificial intelligence for education in mathematics and physics. Our vision is to create a future where anyone, regardless of their location, socioeconomic background, or prior education, has the ability to access and fully utilize advanced technological tools for learning and solving complex problems. We dream of a world where education in science and mathematics is inclusive and accessible to all, facilitated by a global network of collaboration that connects MathGPT with other leading technology and education organizations. This synergy seeks not only to provide resources and knowledge but also to foster an innovative ecosystem of learning and development. We strive to nurture a global community of learners and innovative thinkers, empowered to explore new frontiers in science and contribute to human progress. Through MathGPT, we aim to not only educate but also inspire and trigger a revolution in self-directed and collaborative learning, taking science and mathematics education to a new level of excellence and inclusion.</p>
